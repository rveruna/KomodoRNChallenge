# The Solution to the Challenge

This is my solution to the tech test challenge, where I have completed the given tasks within the allocated time. The solution is focused on the day-to-day role of a React Native developer. Please find below a summary of my solution:

## Environment Setup

To begin, I followed the instructions provided in the docs/setup.md file to ensure the correct setup of the development environment. I made sure that all the required dependencies and tools were installed and properly configured.

## Functionality Implemented

    1. Adding a New Location
        When the user taps the "+" button, a form is displayed to capture the name, description, and location coordinates of the new location.
        For creating an intuitive and user-friendly form, I utilized components from the React Native UI Kitten library.
        After the user submits the form, the new location is stored persistently on the device.

    2. Displaying a List of Saved Locations
        I implemented a screen that shows a list of all saved locations.
        Each location is displayed with its corresponding name and description.
        To efficiently render the list of locations, I utilized the React Native FlatList component.

    3. Opening Native Maps App
        When the user selects a specific location from the list, the native maps application (Apple Maps or Google Maps) opens at the selected location.
        To achieve this functionality, I utilized the Linking API provided by React Native.

## Code Quality Control

To maintain code quality, I implemented the following measures:

    1. Consistent code formatting and adherence to established coding conventions.
    2. Usage of meaningful variable and function names to enhance code readability.
    3. Development of modular and reusable components to promote maintainability.
    4. Graceful handling of errors and edge cases to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Version Control

I used Git for version control and committed all my changes to a remote repository hosted on GitHub. You can find the complete codebase and commit history at the following repository: https://github.com/rveruna/KomodoRNChallenge

## Target Platform

I developed and tested the solution on the Android platform.

## Deliverables

I will provide my solution as a zip file, which contains the complete codebase along with any necessary documentation or additional setup instructions for reviewing and testing the solution.

Thank you for considering my solution, and I look forward to discussing it further during the review conversation.
